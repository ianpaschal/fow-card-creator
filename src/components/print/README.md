# SVG Creation

### Print Size to SVG

Since SVG doesn't allow us to mix units, we have to convert pt measurements to SVG units.

Strokes of 0.75pt are converted to 0.25.

For typography, 1pt is considered to be equal to 0.375 units.

| True   | SVG    | BF Usage |
|--------|--------|-------|
|    4pt | 1.5    | Stat block heading |
|  4.5pt | 1.6875 | Mobility & weapon block headings |
| 4.95pt |        | Metric label |
|    5pt | 1.875  | Modifier custom name |
|  5.7pt | 2.1375 | Unit special rules |
|    6pt | 2.25   | Sub-title, modifier attribute |
| 6.75pt | 2.5
|    7pt | 2.625  | |
|    8pt | 3.0    | Stat block base rating |
|   12pt | 4.5    | |
|   16pt | 6.0    | Title |

Because Open Sans renders slightly differently than Myriad Pro, sometimes a slightly different size has been chosen than what the pure conversion would yield.



1 pt = 1/72 in = 0.3527777778 mm
