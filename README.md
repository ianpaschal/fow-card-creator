> A tool for creating and sharing custom unit cards for the game World War II tabletop war-game: Flames of War

## [Visit the App](https://cardcreator.ianpaschal.com)

## Features

Right now, this project is very much a work-in-progress, but you can follow what is underway and which features will be added next by checking out our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/TbsTJYR7/card-creator).

The eventual aim is the following set of features:

- Create custom unit cards almost identical to official Battlefront cards
- Share your cards with other users
- Rate and favorite other users cards and download them for your own use

## Background

With the release of Version 4 of Flames of War, Battlefront Miniatures made two significant changes:

- The number of units in the game was reduced;
- "Unit Cards", a table-top accessory was introduced;

The reason for the first point was likely to simplify game-play, but also likely to simply Battlefront's SKUs and product catalog.
As for the unit cards, they provided a more convenient way to reference unit stats and special rules during game-play than flipping through pages of a source-book.
They were also purportedly intended to encourage adoption of V4 with V3 players by allowing them to use their existing armies with V4 rules and stats.

Alas! Many V3 players were disappointed to find their favorite obscure vehicle or infantry configuration missing from the unit cards!
This lead to many players creating custom unit cards for their favorite unit which was not yet in-game.
Some examples are below:

- [Custom Unit Card Templates by 1905adventure](http://theminiaturespage.com/boards/msg.mv?id=449701)

In fact, Battlefront themselves also began releasing "community-created, Battlefront-approved" unit cards which matched the official cards in graphic design quality:

Our goal is to streamline and crowd-source this process.

## FAQ

- Do you use any Battlefront graphical assets?
    - No! Everything is created by [@ianpaschal](https://github.com/ianpaschal). The goal was to get the quality on par with Battlefront's, however all graphics, symbols, etc. are created from scratch (or open-source materials).
- Can I create copies of Battlefront's unit cards?
    - No! If you want official units, buy the unit cards!

## Disclaimer

As a historically themed game, Flames of War treads dangerous ground with respect to offensive symbols.
Flames of War Card Creator avoids using any symbols related to Nazism, fascism or other totalitarian regimes as much as possible.
Therefore, all symbols or iconography within the app must be understood to serve the purpose historical accuracy and not as an endorsement of the respective divisions, organizations, regimes, or their leaders.
